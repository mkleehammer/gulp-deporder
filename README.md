Gulp DepOrder plugin
====================
This plugin will reorder JavaScript or CSS files in the stream based on comments at the top of files.
This is useful for automatically ordering files before concatenating them without a full-blown dependency system like requirejs.

The plugin attempts to reorder as little as possible so you can manually order large sets of
files and only use the comments to fine tune.

How to use

### Gulp
For JavaScript files:
```javascript
var deporder = require('gulp-deporder');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
    return gulp.src('./lib/*.js')
        .pipe(deporder())
        .pipe(concat('all.js'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'))
});
```

For CSS files:
```javascript
var deporder = require('gulp-deporder');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');

gulp.task('styles', function() {
    return gulp.src('./lib/*.css')
        .pipe(deporder())
        .pipe(concat('all.css'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'))
});
```

### JavaScript

There is several ways to specify dependencies:
First is single-line:
``// requires: foo.js bar.js``
Second is multi-line if you have lot of dependencies:
```javascript
/* requires:
foo.js
bar.js
*/
```

### CSS
Since CSS doesn't support single-line comments, you should only use multi-line comments:
```css
/* requires:
foo.css
bar.css
*/
```

## Write less, do more
You also need know, that all examples above uses ``requires: foo.js``, but you can also use it without trailing "s", like ``require: foo.js`` or even without colon like ``requires foo.js`` or ``require foo.js``.
And, of course, in multi-line style you can use spaces to indent your dependencies, like:
```javascript
/* require
  foo/bar.js
      bar/foo.js
*/
```
All of those spaces will be cleaned and dependencies are processed correctly.
